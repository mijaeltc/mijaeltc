## Hi there, i'm Mijael, it's a pleasure know us ðŸ‘‹

I am currently in the 8th cycle of the Systems Engineering degree.

I like artificial intelligence and solving complicated problems, I hope to build a career that includes these two factors.
Sometimes I like to think a lot about the meaning of things, sometimes not so much. I also like the song Chandelier by Will Paquin, it's really good, check it out.

### I am currently doing my pre-professional internship as a volunteer with Nassf Travel. ðŸ”­
### I'm learning React, Javascript, SQL ðŸŒ±
### My main goal is to be able to put bread on the table at home and I hope to be able to feel proud of my decisions in the future.
